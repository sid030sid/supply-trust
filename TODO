implement following work flow: user traces item by inputting did, then it clicks on metadata a pop up window opens hich either displays the metadata (if the file is public) or it displays a qr code that must be scanned in order to verify by presenting VP with authorization claim --> verification service (built in download/:cid endpoint that is meant for private files)
add "claim your VC" path in the navigation bar where the user can get VC for accessing private ipfs file --> issuer service (build own endpoints)
