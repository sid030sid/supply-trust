debug error occruing when users with more than one VC issued by SupplyTrust try to perform OID4VP
improve UX by making SupplyTrust be mentioned instead of "connect to unknown org" during OID4VP, potential solution: adapt the verifier-config as done here: https://github.com/pherbke/seneca/blob/main/usecases/resume/src/lib/verifier-config.ts
improve UI by replacing the alert messaging with more appealing material ui components
add loading symbol so that user knows that one needs to wait for supply chain event documentation during OID4VCI
make certs used by issuer and verifier private by storiung it in env variables
